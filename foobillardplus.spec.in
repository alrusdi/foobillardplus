%description
FooBillard++ is an attempt to create a free OpenGL-billard for Linux. Why foo?
Well, Florian Berger had this logo (F.B.-Florian Berger) and then foo sounds a
bit like pool (Somehow he wasn't quite attracted by the name FoolBillard)
If you are a billard-pro and you're missing some physics,
please tell us. Please contact us over sourceforge.net

Started at 12/2010 an advanced version is in progress with foobillard++.
It's not really a new game, but an advanced with a lot of fixes, new
options, graphics and features until the last version of foobillard (2007).
At this point it's started with a special version for the Touch-PC WeTab.
