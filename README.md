## What is FooBillard++?

FooBillard++ is a free OpenGL-billiard game for Linux and based on the
original foobillard 3.0a source from `Florian Berger`. 

![opening](screenshots/foobilliards.png)

### Why foo?

Well, actually he had this logo (F.B.-Florian Berger) and then foo sounds a
bit like pool (Somehow he wasn't quite attracted by the name `FoolBillard`)

If you are a billiard-pro and you're missing some physics,
please tell us. Cause I've implemented it like I think it should work,
which might differ from reality. Please contact us over sourceforge.net

Started at 12/2010 an advanced version is in progress with foobillard++.
It's not really a new game, but an advanced with a lot of fixes, new
options, graphics and features until the last version of foobillard (2007).
At this point it's started with a special version for the Touch-PC WeTab.

### Dependencies

You need to have `SDL 1` installed on your system.
Furthermore `libpng` has to be installed for loading the textures.
And `freetype2` is used for font rendering.
`SDL_net` is used for the networking mode
`SDL_mixer` for sound and music

### Prerequisites:
   - 100% OpenGL compatible graphic card drivers for your operating system.
   
   - The graphic card must have 50 to 80 Megabyte Video-RAM! If the driver can't
   allocate enough graphic card memory, the game graphics is ugly and corrupt!!
   
   - Linux, WeTab, Mac OS 10.6.x or Windows OS (32 or 64 Bit) with a minimum of 10 MB
   free system memory at runtime.
   
### Credits && Thanks 

Many thanks to the band `Zentriert ins Antlitz`, specially Marc Friedrich,
for the music in the game! Have a look on their great site at: http://www.zentriertinsantlitz.de

### The project is powered by the following amazing FOSS:

- OpenGL 1
- GNU C Compiler
- GNU `Autotools`
- The `SDL 1` Simple Media Library
- Eclipse C/C++ IDE
- Gimp Image Manipulation Program
- Blender 3D
- Audacity
- Free 3D graphics from www.terminal26.de
- Free 3D graphics from www.scopia.es
- Free 3d graphics from www.blendswap.com

- Sourceforge.net as hoster
- freecode.com for announcement
- google code for announcement
- youtube as hoster for the video samples


### BUILDING


#### UNIX based platforms

Building for sound support and no Nvidia-related specs are standard.
Please don't use `--enable-nvidia` (it's only for testing.....)

For compilation from source you need the GNU `autoconf` and `automake` packages.
After unpacking the source archive change to the `foobillardplus` directory and
type the following commands (or invoke `buildme.sh`:

```sh
aclocal --force  
autoconf -f  
autoheader -f  
automake -a -c -f  
```

#### OS X
For Mac OS are special files inside the directory OSX from root. There is also a
project file. `Freetype` and `SDL` are included there.
 simply type in main-directory (for standard-installation):


A special very fast version is build with

./configure --enable-special  
make  
make install  

If you want to enable the special WeTab Version type:

```sh 
./configure --enable-wetab  
make  
make install  
```

That version would be only run on a WeTab Tablet-PC


### configure options

`--enable-wetab`:

This builds a version for the German tablet WeTab (and only for that!!)
Please don't use other optimization flags discussed later in this document, because this option is the only one you need!!

`--enable-touch`:

This build a special version for generic touch-devices

`--enable-mathsingle=ARG`:

Compile math single precision (default=yes). If you use "no" it is compiled for math double precision. 
**Clients with mixed single or double precision are not compatible in network games**

`--enable-fastmath`:

Compile fast math routine in (default=no). With set this configure option, special
optimized math-routines for cosine, sine, tangents are used. This has nothing to do
with `SSE` intrinsics. The fast math routines are not nearly as accurate as the
standard routines, but enough for the game.

`--enable-sse=ARG`:

Compile with intrinsics SSE commands and use. With enabled SSE, the use of
`enable-mathsingle` defaults to yes. Double precision are automatically disabled.
Use `SSE` only on Intel or AMD based CPU systems!


`--enable-network=ARG`:

Compile for IP-network game support (default=yes). With no as argument, all
network support is not compiled.

`--enable-sound=ARG`:

Enable sound (default=yes). With no as argument sound support is not compiled.

`--enable-win`:

If set to yes, the source is compiling for ms-windows (32 and 64 Bit). You have to use
as runtime environment MinGW/Msys under MS-Windows.

### config file (~/.foobillardrc)

You can place a config file named `.foobillardrc` in your home directory.
Windows hold the file in the directory associated with the content of the
environment variable `USERPROFILE`.

This file can contain all possible CLI arguments (without the "-" prefix; one line for each argument).
CLI arguments are parsed last, so they override the ".foobillardrc" settings. 

### Features

- Wood paneled table with gold covers and gold diamonds
- Reflections on balls
- Shadow pixmaps
- Detail switching of balls according to distance
- Zoom in/out - hold right mouse button
- FOV +/- - hold right mouse button + `CTRL`
- Rotate - hold left mouse button
- Animated cue
- Simple billiard rules for 8 and 9-ball
- Simple AI-Player
- Strength adjustment
- Eccentric hit adjustment (button2 + Shift)
- Lens flare
- CLI options
- Config file (~/.foobillardrc)
- Lightweight red/green stereo !!!!
- Sound and music (using SDL)
- Status line for info in gameplay
- Advanced hud
- Jump shots
- Advanced snipping mode
- Tournament for all games
- Basic OpenGL improvements (anisotropic, antialias)
- Full playable in bird's eye view
- Tron like game mode
- Glass balls, if you like

Press <F1> in game for a quick help!

### red-green stereo

One picture is drawn on red channel only, the other one on the other both channels (green, blue) so you can use either a green or blue or cyan filter for one eye (left), and a red one for the other eye (right).


### Network game

IP network support is possible. Now with IPv4. IPv6 is supported in the future.
This function is heavily BETA.

### Optimization problem of the GCC suite (don't use with WeTab compiling!)

On some systems certain `gcc` optimisations may result in unstable code. To
To output possible optimisations on the target arch, invoke:

```sh
gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers > /tmp/O3-opts
```

Check the generated file for available optimisations on your system. Please use these wisely and don't confuse these with general `configure` arguments.

The `configure` script supports the `--enable-standard` argument.

To pass customised `CFLAGS`, use `--enable-special`. No optimisation flags are set by default.

The `--enable-optimization` switch uses some special level of optimisations and will produce hopefully a stable program. Default value is `no`.


With this switch the highest optimisation level is used. Be careful: there is no
guarantee from the author that this will produce a stable program but does quicken the build time.

### KNOWN BUGS

- Intel integrated graphic chips
- On some Intel integrated graphic chips (GMA) the game is not playable with Linux.

**You need really 100% OpenGL compatible graphic card drivers.**
